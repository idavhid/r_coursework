Data Cleaning and Machine Learning in R

Overview

This repository contains an R script for loading datasets, performing data standardization, and applying multiple machine learning models to compare their performance. The goal is to identify the best-performing model based on standard evaluation metrics.

The project is part of the MSc Data Science program, under the module R for Data Science (DSM110), for the Midterm Coursework: Data Cleaning.
